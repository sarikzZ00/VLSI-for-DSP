This is code for digital frequency synthesis logic in SystemVerilog based on ![top_level_diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a237f4d1-cb84-4ee3-bb51-5681b64be2c8) diagram. 
It contains a cosine lookup table in fixed point representation; a controller that produces a modulated output signal alternating frequency between 2.3 MHz and 0.3 Mhz; and my_waveform_gen that generates sine and cosine waveforms
